# Simple Implementation of a Parser/Code Formatter

The program is created to parse and format code written in a language similar to the C language, with no support for any complex features. It is written for a Integrated Course Design project for DS and C language.

The EBNF of this language is defined in SimpleParser/Language_EBNF.md.

The Code is NOT readable nor maintainable due to the lack of comments and the confusing structure. The author simply did not think of them when coding.

Still, if you want, feel free to use this code as reference.
